## Project Overview

This application is designed for patients and medical professionals, offering virtual pre-diagnostic services to individuals who may not have immediate access to healthcare. By connecting patients with volunteering health professionals, including medical students and doctors, the aim is to provide early warnings for serious conditions or offer reassurance to users. This platform helps users avoid relying solely on internet searches for medical information.

When a user logs into their profile, they can input their symptoms, which are then sent to a health professional for assessment. The professional can then provide a preliminary diagnosis to the user.
